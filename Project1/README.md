# Computational Physics Project 1
 First project in fys4150 Computational Physics.
 The main program is found in the master repository, named project1.py. This file contains all the solvers, and a main function 
 that can be run from the command-line, with argument: argv[1] = input-size, argv[2] = method. For method, choose: lu, thomas or symmetric. 
 In the benchmarks folder, I have done tests corresponding to the different parts of the project. Those can be ran by cloning the repository to your own computer. Those are also used to create the plots and tables in the report. In the benchmark folder, you will also find the output of the files ran. The files that contains the results will be named the same, but with results added to the end.
