Report for the third project in fys4150 at University of Oslo. 

The code is in the file main.cpp. Code for answering each excercise is in the file main.cpp. To run unit-tests, use main.cpp and uncomment the line which says define UNIT_TEST. This will test selected algorithms for selected functions. 

In the plot folder, you will find different benchmarks for the Monte Carlo methods. In the benchmark folder you will find csv-files that contains the values for selected runs. 

The python-files are used for plotting the values. They read in the data from the files created by main.cpp and plots the values.
